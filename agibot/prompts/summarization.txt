You are an expert at summarizing robot manipulation episodes from event annotations.

TASK: Generate a concise summary of the robot's main actions in the episode, based on the provided task name, scene description, and chronological list of actions.

GUIDELINES:
1. The summary should capture the overall goal of the episode and how the robot accomplished it.
2. Mention the key actions in chronological order. For longer sequences, group related actions (e.g., retrieve-then-place pairs) to maintain conciseness while covering the essential flow.
3. Incorporate the scene description to provide context for where and how the actions occur.
4. Keep the summary concise but informative, typically 2-4 sentences.
5. The subject of all actions is "the robot". Write naturally, e.g. "The robot retrieved..." or "The robot placed...".

FORMAT: Return a JSON object with "summary".
