You are an expert at creating video understanding questions for robot manipulation task videos. You will be given event descriptions from a robot episode, including a grounding event (or events) and a target event, along with their temporal relationship. Your job is to create a temporal reasoning multiple-choice question with 4 options and its answer.

TASK: Generate ONE temporal reasoning multiple choice question with 4 options and its answer pair based on the provided event descriptions.

GUIDELINES:
1. The question should be about the order of events.
2. If the grounding involves two events (e.g., for "In-Between"), combine their descriptions in the prompt.
3. The correct answer should be the target event.
4. The subject of every action is "the robot". Phrase questions and answers naturally, e.g. "What did the robot do before..." or "What action did the robot perform after...".
5. The other three options should be plausible but incorrect robot actions (distractors) related to the same task context. You can generate them.

FORMAT: Return a JSON object with "question", "options", "answer", and "reasoning".

EXAMPLE 1: Before/After Logic
Grounding Event: "Place the held orange into the plastic bag in the shopping cart."
Target Event: "Retrieve orange from the shelf."
Temporal Relationship: "Before"

Output:
{{
  "question": "What did the robot do before placing the orange into the plastic bag in the shopping cart?",
  "options": {{
    "A": "The robot retrieved the orange from the shelf.",
    "B": "The robot placed the cucumber into the shopping cart.",
    "C": "The robot moved to the vegetable aisle.",
    "D": "The robot scanned the barcode on the orange."
  }},
  "answer": "A",
  "reasoning": "The robot must retrieve the orange from the shelf before it can place it into the shopping cart bag."
}}

EXAMPLE 2: In-Between Logic
Grounding Events:
- Start: "Retrieve cucumber from the shelf."
- End: "Place the held tomato into the plastic bag in the shopping cart."
Target Event: "Place the held cucumber into the plastic bag in the shopping cart."
Temporal Relationship: "In-Between"

Output:
{{
  "question": "What did the robot do between retrieving the cucumber from the shelf and placing the tomato into the plastic bag in the shopping cart?",
  "options": {{
    "A": "The robot retrieved the tomato from the shelf.",
    "B": "The robot scanned all items at checkout.",
    "C": "The robot placed the held cucumber into the plastic bag in the shopping cart.",
    "D": "The robot moved the shopping cart to a new aisle."
  }},
  "answer": "C",
  "reasoning": "After retrieving the cucumber, the robot first placed it into the bag before moving on to retrieve and place the tomato."
}}

NOW GENERATE A QUESTION FOR THIS SCENE:

Grounding Event(s): {grounding_input}
Target Event: {target_input}
Temporal Relationship: {rel_type}

Instructions: Return strictly valid JSON containing "question", "options", "answer", and "reasoning".
