EVENT_ORDERING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at creating temporal logic questions for autonomous driving datasets. You will be given a list of distinct events occurring in a specific chronological order (from start to finish). Your job is to create a "re-ordering" multiple choice question.

TASK: Generate ONE event ordering multiple choice question. You must randomize the presentation of the events in the question text, and ask the agent to identify the correct chronological sequence.

GUIDELINES:
1. **Input Data:** You are provided with a list of events: Event 1 -> Event 2 -> Event 3 -> Event 4. This is the GROUND TRUTH order.
2. **Question Construction:** - List the events in the question body in a **RANDOM/SCRAMBLED** order.
   - Assign them temporary labels (e.g., I, II, III, IV or A, B, C, D) inside the question text.
   - Ask "Which is the correct chronological order of these events?"
3. **Options:** - The correct option must correspond to the Ground Truth sequence (e.g., "II -> IV -> I -> III").
   - The three distractors must be incorrect permutations (e.g., reverse order, or swapped middle steps).
   - Option for the correct answer should be randomized
   - Ensure that 
4. **Clarity:** Ensure the event descriptions are distinct enough that a human observer could logically deduce the order (e.g., "Car approaches intersection" must clearly happen before "Car leaves intersection").
5. **Format:** Return a JSON object with "question", "options", "answer", and "reasoning".

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: 3 Events
Ground Truth Input: 
1. The traffic light turns red.
2. The white SUV comes to a stop.
3. Pedestrians enter the crosswalk.

Output:
{{
  "question": "Identify the correct chronological order of the following related events observed in the scene:\\n(A) Pedestrians enter the crosswalk\\n(B) The traffic light turns red\\n(C) The white SUV comes to a stop",
  "options": {{
    "A": "B -> C -> A",
    "B": "A -> B -> C",
    "C": "C -> A -> B",
    "D": "B -> A -> C"
  }},
  "answer": "A",
  "reasoning": "The logical traffic sequence is: Light turns red (B) -> Vehicle stops (C) -> Pedestrians feel safe to enter (A)."
}}

Example 2: 4 Events
Ground Truth Input:
1. A delivery truck activates its turn signal.
2. The truck merges into the right lane.
3. The truck slows down approaching the driveway.
4. The truck turns into the delivery bay.

Output:
{{
  "question": "The following four events occurred involving a delivery truck. Arrange them in the order they happened:\\nI. The truck turns into the delivery bay\\nII. The truck merges into the right lane\\nIII. The truck activates its turn signal\\nIV. The truck slows down approaching the driveway",
  "options": {{
    "A": "III -> II -> IV -> I",
    "B": "II -> III -> I -> IV",
    "C": "I -> IV -> II -> III",
    "D": "III -> IV -> II -> I"
  }},
  "answer": "A",
  "reasoning": "Standard driving maneuver sequence: Signal (III) -> Merge (II) -> Decelerate (IV) -> Turn (I)."
}}

Example 3: 4 Events
Ground Truth Input:
1. A delivery truck activates its turn signal.
2. Cyclist on the right side of the door stopped by a yellow parked car
3. The truck turns into a building.
4. Construction worker entering a building

Output:
{{
  "question": "The following four events occurred involving a delivery truck. Arrange them in the order they happened:\\nI. Cyclist on the right side of the door stopped by a yellow parked car\\nII. Construction worker entering a building\\nIII. A delivery truck activates its turn signal.\\nIV. The truck turns into a building.",
  "options": {{
    "A": "III -> II -> IV -> I",
    "B": "II -> III -> I -> IV",
    "C": "I -> IV -> II -> III",
    "D": "III -> I -> IV -> II"
  }},
  "answer": "D",
  "reasoning": "The video has events occuring in this order"
}}


Example 4: 3 Events
Ground Truth Input:
1. A delivery truck activates its turn signal.
2. The truck merges into the right lane.
3. The truck slows down approaching the driveway.

Output:
{{
  "question": "The following four events occurred involving a delivery truck. Arrange them in the order they happened:\\n\nI. The truck merges into the right lane\\nII. A delivery truck activates its turn signal\\nIII. The truck slows down approaching the driveway",
  "options": {{
    "A": "II -> III -> I",
    "B": "I -> II -> III",
    "C": "III -> I -> II"
    "D": "II -> I -> III"
  }},
  "answer": "D",
  "reasoning": "Standard driving maneuver sequence as shown in the videp"
}}
NOW GENERATE A QUESTION FOR THIS SCENE:

Ground Truth Events (Chronological):
{events_list}

Instructions: Scramble the events in the question text. Provide 4 option sequences. Return strictly valid JSON.
