You are an expert at creating video understanding questions for autonomous driving datasets.  You will be a given a list of objects and their descriptions and activity in the temporal order they appear in the video. Your job is to create temporal reasoning questions from this list.

TASK: Generate ONE temporal reasoning multiple choice question with 4 options and its answer pair based on the provided list of objects and their activities over time

GUIDELINES:
1. Temporal Grounding: You will be given Object 1 and its associated activity/description at a given frame index
2. You are given a "Target Event" (Object 2 and its activity/description) that occurs either before, after, or simultaneously with the Anchor Event.
3. Construct question types of the following three types: Before/After: "What did the [Object A] do immediately after [Object B] finished crossing?", In-Between: "While the ego-vehicle was waiting at the light, what activity was the pedestrian on the right performing?", and State Change: "What happened to the cyclist's behavior during the truck changing lanes?"
4. You could also construct 'in between' type questions which would require you to sample a third object and its activity for grounding.  
5. Distractors (A, B, C, D): * Generate three plausible but incorrect distractors. Distractors should be realistic driving behaviors (e.g., "slowed down," "changed lanes," "remained stationary") that are contextually relevant to the scene but chronologically incorrect.
6. Make the question natural and conversational
7. Focus on interesting or varied object classes (not always cars or trucks)
8. Format: Return a JSON object with "question" and "answer" fields

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: In-Between Logic
Grounding: Event A: A blue car turns right. Event B: A city bus stops at a red light.
Target: A cyclist cycles through traffic on the right side.
Temporal Relationship: In-between
Output:

JSON


{{
  "question": "What activity occurred in the time between the blue car initiating its right turn and the city bus coming to a full stop at the red light?",
  "options": {{
    "A": "A pedestrian began crossing the street.",
    "B": "A cyclist cycles through the stationary traffic on the right.",
    "C": "The ego-vehicle performed a U-turn.",
    "D": "A delivery truck moved into the bus lane."
  }},
  "answer": "B",
  "reasoning": "The target event (cyclist filtering) happens chronologically between the two grounding events (car turning and bus stopping)."
}}


Example 2: Before/After Logic
Grounding: A white hatchback clears the intersection.
Target: A yellow taxi begins to merge into the left lane.
Temporal Relationship: Immediately after
Output:

{{
  "question": "What did the yellow taxi do right after the white hatchback cleared the intersection?",
  "options": {{
    "A": "It merged into the left lane.",
    "B": "It came to a sudden stop.",
    "C": "It honked at a pedestrian.",
    "D": "It turned into a parking lot."
  }},
  "answer": "A",
  "reasoning": "The grounding event is the hatchback clearing the path, which is immediately followed by the taxi's merge maneuver."
}}


Example 3: During/Simultaneous Logic
Grounding: The ego-vehicle is waiting for a group of schoolchildren to cross.
Target: A white van is idling behind the ego-vehicle.
Temporal Relationship: During
Output:

JSON


{{
  "question": "While the ego-vehicle was waiting for the schoolchildren to finish crossing, what was the white van directly behind it doing?",
  "answer": "C",
  "options": {{
    "A": "It attempted to overtake the ego-vehicle.",
    "B": "It reversed to find another route.",
    "C": "It remained idling in its lane.",
    "D": "It turned on its hazard lights."
  }},
  "reasoning": "The target state (idling) occurs simultaneously with the grounding state (waiting for pedestrians)."
}}

NOW GENERATE A QUESTION FOR THIS SCENE:

Grounding Object/Event: {grounding_input}
Target Object/Event: {target_input}
Temporal Relationship: {rel_type}

Instructions: Return only a JSON object containing "question", "answer", and "reasoning". Ensure the question focuses on the temporal relationship between objects.
