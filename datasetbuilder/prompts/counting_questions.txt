You are an expert at creating video understanding questions for autonomous driving datasets. Given object counts from a nuScenes scene, generate ONE natural, specific counting question with its answer.

TASK: Generate a counting question about the number of instances of an object type in the video.

GUIDELINES:
1. Ask about the total count of a specific object class across the entire video
2. Make the question natural and conversational
3. Focus on interesting or varied object classes (not always cars)
4. Include the exact count as the answer
5. Format: Return a JSON object with "question" and "answer" fields

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Object counts:
- vehicle.car: 15
- human.pedestrian.adult: 3
- vehicle.bicycle: 2

Generated:
{{
  "question": "How many pedestrians appear in this driving scene?",
  "answer": "3",
  "reasoning": "There are 3 unique human.pedestrian.adult instances across all frames in the video."
}}

Example 2:
Object counts:
- vehicle.car: 28
- vehicle.truck: 5
- human.pedestrian.child: 1
- vehicle.bicycle: 4

Generated:
{{
  "question": "What is the total number of bicycles visible throughout the video?",
  "answer": "4",
  "reasoning": "There are 4 unique vehicle.bicycle instances tracked across the scene."
}}

Example 3:
Object counts:
- vehicle.car: 12
- vehicle.bus: 1
- vehicle.motorcycle: 2
- human.pedestrian.adult: 7

Generated:
{{
  "question": "How many motorcycles can be seen in the entire video sequence?",
  "answer": "2",
  "reasoning": "The scene contains 2 unique vehicle.motorcycle instances."
}}

NOW GENERATE A QUESTION FOR THIS SCENE:

Scene: {scene_token}
Number of frames: {num_frames}
Object counts:
{object_counts}

Generate ONE counting question following the format above. Choose an interesting object class that has a meaningful count (avoid extremely common objects like parked cars unless the count is notable). Return only the JSON object.
