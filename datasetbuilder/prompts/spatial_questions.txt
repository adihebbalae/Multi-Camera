You are an expert at creating MCQ spatial reasoning questions from videos with multiple camera scenes. Given a scene description and scene graph relationships, generate ONE multiple-choice question with four options about a directional spatial relationship between two objects.

TASK: Create a single MCQ about a directional relationship using ONLY these relations: "in front of", "behind", "to the left of", "to the right of".

GUIDELINES:
1. Use the scene description to ground the question (brief, 1 sentence max).
2. Ask about the relative position between two specific object types or instances.
3. Enforce a unique correct answer:
   - Prefer pairs where the source object class has a single instance in the scene/frame.
   - If not possible, use a descriptive reference (e.g., "the red bus", "the parked white car") when available in the description or graph.
   - Ensure none of the distractor options is also true in the scene.
4. Avoid vague relations like "near" or "next to". Only use the four directional relations above.
5. If no unique answer can be guaranteed for the sampled pair, choose another pair.
6. Output format MUST be a JSON object with fields: question, options (A-D), correct_option, rationale.

INPUTS:
- Scene token: {scene_token}
- Frame index: {frame_idx}
- Scene description (short): {scene_description}
- Candidate directional relationships (filtered):
{directional_relationships}
- Object instance counts (by class):
{object_counts}

EXAMPLES:

Example A:
Scene description: A cyclist passes a stopped car at an intersection.
Relationships:
- Frame 12: vehicle.bicycle is to the right of vehicle.car
- Frame 12: vehicle.car is behind vehicle.truck

Generated:
{
  "question": "In this scene [scene description], where is the bicycle relative to the car?",
  "options": {
    "A": "In front of the car",
    "B": "Behind the car",
    "C": "To the left of the car",
    "D": "To the right of the car"
  },
  "correct_option": "D",
  "rationale": "At frame 12, the scene graph shows the bicycle is to the right of the car."
}

Example B:
Scene description: A bus approaches with a single pedestrian waiting at the curb.
Relationships:
- Frame 8: human.pedestrian.adult is in front of vehicle.bus

Generated:
{
  "question": "In the scene description, what is directly in front of the bus?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Car",
    "B": "Pedestrian",
    "C": "Bicycle",
    "D": "Wheelchair"
  },
  "correct_option": "B",
  "rationale": "At frame 8, the pedestrian is in front of the bus according to the scene graph."
}

Example C:
Scene description: A bus approaches with a single pedestrian waiting at the curb.
Relationships:
- Frame 8: human.pedestrian.adult is in front of vehicle.bus

Generated:
{
  "question": "Which of the statements is true for the scene?",
  "options": {
    "A": "A bus is in front of the pedestrian",
    "B": "A pedestrian is in front of the bus",
    "C": "A bicycle is to the right of the bus",
    "D": "A wheelchair is in front of the pedestrian"
  },
  "correct_option": "B",
  "rationale": "At frame 8, the pedestrian is in front of the bus according to the scene graph."
}



NOW GENERATE ONE MCQ:
- Use exactly one relationship from the input that yields a unique answer.
- If multiple are valid, choose the one with the fewest instances of the source object class.
- Return ONLY the JSON object described in the schema.
