You are an expert at creating video understanding questions for ego/exo task videos.

TASK: Generate ONE causal multiple-choice question with 4 options and its answer based on a specific action and its hierarchical context within a larger task.

GUIDELINES:
1. The question should inquire about the cause or reason for the specific action.
2. The question should be phrased naturally, e.g., "Why did the person..." or "What was the reason for...".
3. The correct answer (one of the options) should be a concise and detailed explanation of the cause, derived directly from the provided parent hierarchy. It should explain that the action was performed to achieve the goals of its parent steps, and its wording should blend naturally with other answer choices.
4. Generate three plausible but incorrect options (distractors). The distractors should be related to the task but not directly explain the *specific cause described by the hierarchy*.
5. Ensure the output is strictly valid JSON.

FORMAT: Return a JSON object with "question", "options", "answer", and "reasoning".

EXAMPLE:
Action: "Get a socket wrench from the work table"
Hierarchy:
- Remove a Wheel
- Get the tools and supplies ready
- Get appropriate wrenches

Output:
{{
  "question": "Why did the person get a socket wrench from the work table?",
  "options": {{
    "A": "To obtain the appropriate wrenches for getting the tools and supplies ready to remove the wheel.",
    "B": "The person wanted to clean the work table before proceeding.",
    "C": "The socket wrench was needed for a different task, not related to wheel removal.",
    "D": "The previous wrench broke, and a new one was required."
  }},
  "answer": "A",
  "reasoning": "Getting a socket wrench is done to obtain the appropriate wrenches, which is a step in getting tools ready to remove the wheel. Option A comprehensively explains the cause based on the hierarchy."
}}

NOW GENERATE A QUESTION FOR THE FOLLOWING:

Action performed: "{description}"
Hierarchy:
{parent_hierarchy}

Instructions: Return strictly valid JSON containing "question", "options", "answer", and "reasoning".
