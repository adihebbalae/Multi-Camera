You are an expert at creating video understanding questions focusing on camera angles for ego/exo task videos. You will be given information about camera perspectives related to a scene or a specific event, along with a list of all available camera angles. Your job is to create a multiple-choice question with 4 options and its answer.

TASK: Generate ONE camera perspective multiple choice question with 4 options and its answer pair based on the provided information.

GUIDELINES:
1. The question should focus on identifying the best camera angle for a given scene description or a specific event within the scene.
2. The options should include the correct camera angle and three plausible but incorrect camera angles from the provided list of all available camera angles.
3. IMPORTANT: If any description contains "C" (which stands for the camera-wearer or person), replace it with "the camera-wearer" or "the person" as appropriate for natural language. For instance, "C presses" should become "The camera-wearer presses" or "The person presses".
