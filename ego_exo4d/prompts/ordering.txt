You are an expert at creating temporal logic questions for ego/exo task videos. You will be given a list of event descriptions from a video in a specific chronological order (from start to finish). Your job is to create a "re-ordering" multiple choice question.

TASK: Generate ONE event ordering multiple-choice question with 4 options and its answer pair based on the provided chronological event list.

GUIDELINES:
1. Randomize the presentation of the events within the question text, assigning them temporary labels (e.g., I, II, III, IV).
2. IMPORTANT: If any event description contains "C" (which stands for the camera-wearer or person), replace it with "the camera-wearer" or "the person" as appropriate for natural language. For instance, "C presses" should become "The camera-wearer presses" or "The person presses".
3. The correct answer must be the sequence that matches the ground truth chronological order; the other three options should be plausible but incorrect permutations (e.g., reversed or swapped steps).
4. Ensure the descriptions are distinct enough that the order can be logically deduced from the visual cues provided.

FORMAT: Return a JSON object with "question", "options", "answer", and "reasoning".

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: 3 Events
Ground Truth Events (Chronological):
1. C picks up a white ceramic bowl from the set of ceramic bowls on the countertop with her right hand.
2. C pours the rice vinegar from its bottle into the stainless steel spoon in her left hand.
3. C stirs the rice vinegar mixture in the ceramic bowl with the stainless steel spoon in her right hand.

Output:
{{
  "question": "Identify the correct chronological order of the following related events observed in the scene:\\nI. The person stirs the rice vinegar mixture in the ceramic bowl with the stainless steel spoon.\\nII. The person picks up a white ceramic bowl from the set of ceramic bowls on the countertop.\\nIII. The person pours rice vinegar from its bottle into a stainless steel spoon held in her left hand.",
  "options": {{
    "A": "I -> II -> III",
    "B": "II -> III -> I",
    "C": "III -> II -> I",
    "D": "II -> I -> III"
  }},
  "answer": "B",
  "reasoning": "The logical preparation sequence begins with the person obtaining the white ceramic bowl (II), followed by measuring out the rice vinegar into a spoon (III), and finally stirring the mixture within the bowl (I)."
}}

Example 2: 4 Events
Ground Truth Events (Chronological):
1. C presses a rear wheel of a bicycle with his right hand.
2. C picks an auxiliary wrench from a table with his right.
3. C picks a socket wrench from the table with his right.
4. C removes a chain from the wheel with his right hand.

Output:
{{
  "question": "Identify the correct chronological order of the following related events observed in the scene:\\nI. The person removes a chain from the wheel with his right hand.\\nII. The person picks an auxiliary wrench from a table with his right hand.\\nIII. The person presses a rear wheel of a bicycle with his right hand.\\nIV. The person picks a socket wrench from the table with his right hand.",
  "options": {{
    "A": "III -> II -> IV -> I",
    "B": "I -> IV -> II -> III",
    "C": "II -> III -> IV -> I",
    "D": "III -> IV -> II -> I"
  }},
  "answer": "A",
  "reasoning": "The sequence begins with the person inspecting the bicycle wheel (III), followed by picking up an auxiliary wrench (II) and then a socket wrench later in the process (IV) before finally performing the mechanical task of removing the chain (I)."
}}

NOW GENERATE A QUESTION FOR THIS SCENE:

Ground Truth Events (Chronological):
